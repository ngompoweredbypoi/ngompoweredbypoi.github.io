    <p class="devinfo">Hello there👋. My name is Muhammed Mokhtar, known as Mokho and my username is @ngompoweredbypoi on everywhere😊. Just a little guy who's born in 2007 and loves technology💻🖥️. I also have no friends and an agressive community😥. 
    So if you think that you want to support my development and make it bigger, you can donate at my sweat wallet with my username I mentioned above😁 (@ngompoweredbypoi). And please, always be family-friendly for the whole world. These people are humans exactly like you😅😘.
